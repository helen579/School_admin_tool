# School_admin_tool
Project:- BASIC SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION TOOL

The main objective of the School administration program is to enable the user to enter the student data, pre-process the data and write it into a file.

The concepts that we have used in the project include File Handling, Functions and Methods.

This Project will consist of the following steps:

1. Entering or asking user to enter Student information.
2. Pre-processing the collected data. ie. Converting the data into a different format that will be easier for us to process.
3. Writing all the pre-processed data into a File.
